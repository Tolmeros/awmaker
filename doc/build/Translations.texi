@c It is generally considered good practice for Tex and Texinfo formats to keep sentences on
@c different lines, using the fact that in the end they will be merged in paragraph anyway, because
@c it makes the patchs clearer about where the changes actually are.

@chapter Enabling Languages support

@sc{Window Maker} has the possibility to be translated in many languages, but by default none of
them will be installed, and the support for translation will not be compiled.

To enable the translation capabilities, you have to specify which language(s) you want to be
installed: this is done with the variable @env{LINGUAS} when running the @command{configure} script.
This variable should contain the space-separated list of languages you want to install.

You could for instance enable both French (@code{fr}) and Dutch (@code{nl}) with this:

@example
./configure LINGUAS="fr nl"
@end example

You can of course add any other option that you want to the @command{configure} command.
From the moment you specify the variable, the @command{configure} script will check that you have
the appropriate dependencies for this (basically the @code{gettext} function and the @code{libintl}
library); when you run @command{make} to compile the project, it will also compile the translation
(@code{mo} files) for the language(s) you asked (if available, of course), and during
@command{make install} it will install them in the usual directory.


@c --------------------------------------------------------------------- LINGUAS at system level ---
@section Setting @env{LINGUAS} at system level

As the variable @env{LINGUAS} is quite standard, you also have the possibility to set its value in
the @file{config.site} file for @sc{Autoconf}.
This file can be placed in one of these paths:

@itemize @bullet
@item @file{@emph{<prefix>}/share/config.site}
@item @file{@emph{<prefix>}/etc/config.site}
@end itemize

This way, the same language list will be used for all the programs that use @sc{Autoconf} that you
would compile.
Please note that if you also specify a value on the command line, it will have precedence over the
value in that file.
