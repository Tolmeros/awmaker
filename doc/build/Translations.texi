@c This documentation is written in Texinfo format:
@c   https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/
@c
@c The reference checker is the GNU texi2any tool, which can be invoked like this:
@c   texi2any --plaintext --no-split --verbose Translations.texi
@c
@c If you modify this file, you may want to spell-check it with:
@c    aspell --lang=en_GB --mode=texinfo check Translations.texi
@c
@c The length of lines in this file is set to 100 because it tends to keep sentences together
@c despite the embedded @commands{};
@c
@c It is generally considered good practice for Tex and Texinfo formats to keep sentences on
@c different lines, using the fact that in the end they will be merged in paragraph anyway, because
@c it makes the patchs clearer about where the changes actually are.
